## System Configuration Editor

SCE - System Configuration Editor

System Configuration Editor is a DOS utility built using Turbo Pascal
7.0 and Turbo Vision as tool to edit MS/PC/Free DOS configuration files,
i.e., AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and FDCONFIG.SYS.

SCE allows you to see at a glance all of your configuration files. Most
system configuration changes happen in multiple files. While you can use
a multi file editor to open each individual file, SCE automatically
searches for an opens these files and displays them in a cascading
windows.
